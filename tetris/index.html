<script>alert("Note for collage admissions people: First, thanks so much for checking out my work! I just want to clarify this is not the same Tetris that I talk about in my CommonApp essay. I made this Tetris completely separably cause I wanted to try out using audio with JavaScript and because I wanted to make it with only text like the original. Please see github.com/michaellesirge/neural-network for the tetris with AI.")</script>
